CAPTAIN’S LOG | SY 324 D 220 | TRANSMISSION WITH A SENIOR SCIENTIST

She puts a bone fragment against my tongue.

She says,  
_archaeologists did this --_  
    _-- do you know what an archaeologist is?_  
   _like a historian with sticky fingers --_   
_-- to test for bone or rock._  
_feel that tack? the way it wants to hold your tongue?_  
_that was a person, once_  

I say,  
What was their name? 

She says,  
_i like you better than the last one, you know._


CAPTAIN’S LOG | SY 324 D 348 | TRANSMISSION WITH A SENIOR SCIENTIST

She puts orange peels against my tongue.   

She says,   
_tangy, aren’t they?_   
_got a chemical flavor to them._  
_i think it’s all the chemicals._  

I say,  
Are you meant to eat them just like this?

She says,  
_no,_  
_not just like this._  
_there’s flesh inside; you eat that first_  
_you can candy these._   
_if you like._  

I say,  
Bring them back when they’re candied, then.

She says,  
_Sugar rations just ran out._  
_And I don’t think you’re meant to have sugar, you know._  
_But I’ll bring you some next week, if you remind me._  


CAPTAIN’S LOG | SY 324 D 353 | RECORD OF KNOWLEDGE  

Candied orange peels  
fed off plump, sugar-wrinkled fingers  
are worth the extra time it takes  
for proper decontamination.  


CAPTAIN’S LOG | SY 325 D 004 | TRANSMISSION WITH A SENIOR SCIENTIST  

She puts a fission core against my tongue.   

She says,  
_this used to be impossible, you know_  

I say,   
No, you just didn’t know how to do it, yet.  
  
She says,  
_functionally, those are the same._   

I say,  
Functionally, they are not.  

She says,  
_functionally, you are a bitch._  
  
I say,  
Functionally, you are insubordinate.   

She says,   
_we’ll have to stop doing this dance one day._  


CAPTAIN’S LOG | SY 325 D 005 | TRANSMISSION WITH A SENIOR SCIENTIST

She puts her fingertips against my tongue.   

She says,   
_Is this a kiss?_  

I say,   
It is not recognized as such,   
usually.  
  
She says,  
_how about now?_  

I say,  
perhaps   

She says,  
_now?_  

I say nothing.  


CAPTAIN’S LOG | SY 325 D 149 | TRANSMISSION WITH A SENIOR SCIENTIST

She puts a corn husk against my tongue.  

She says,  
_the liquid fuels are running out._  
 
I say,  
The levels have been low for months.  
Unauthorized couplings have offset the population by far greater than our estimation.  

She says,  
_i don’t want to hear you say that again._  

I say,  
Unauthorized couplings?

She says,  
_people have been saying things like that for centuries._  
_not you, too._   

I say,  
I’ll look into the fuel situation.

What happened to the last one?  

_Which last one?_  

You said you liked me better.   
What happened to her?  

_Oh._   
_Magnetic corruption. All the way down to the binary files, couldn’t be repaired._   

Oh. 

_We have better safeguards, now, for the…_  
_For you._   
_It doesn’t matter, anymore. Hey,_   
_don’t look like that._   

You miss her?

_No. Yes. I don’t know._   
_She certainly didn’t let me do this._   


CAPTAIN’S LOG | S 325 D 240 | TRANSMISSION WITH A SENIOR SCIENTIST  

She puts a meteorite against my tongue.  

She says,  
_the SS Bannockburn sank in Lake Superior in nineteen oh two (standard years)_  
_on the twenty first of november (standard months, standard days)._  
_it was never found._  

I say,  
After all that time? 

She says,  
_all that time._ 

I say,  
How do you lose something so large in a place so finite? 

She says,  
_you don’t understand these lakes_

I say,   
You don’t understand what it means to be finite.

She puts an oil droplet on my tongue.

She says,  
_The ship needs more power,_  
_we aren’t getting enough from the harvests, we aren’t getting enough from the solar routing, we aren’t getting enough from any of it, you know, we need --_
_sorry._   
_i know you know._  
_what’s there to do about it?_  

I say,  
There are too many people aboard.   
The resource imbalance is intractable.   

She says,  
_They have names._   
_Make it tractable._
